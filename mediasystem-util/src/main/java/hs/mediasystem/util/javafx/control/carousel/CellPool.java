/**
 * A cell pool keeps track of a set of cell instances.  The pool
 * automatically expands to meet demand.<p>
 *
 * Getting cells from a pool marks those cells as active (in use), and
 * they will remain active until the pool is reset.  When getting a
 * new cell, the pool will attempt to reuse inactive cells where
 * possible or expand the pool with new cells when needed.<p>
 *
 * Resetting the pool makes all cells available for reuse.  Trimming
 * the pool removes all unused cells.<p>
 *
 * Typical usage for a cell based control is to reset the pool before
 * rendering starts, then get the required cells needed for rendering
 * (which marks them as active) and then trim the pool at the end of
 * the rendering phase, which removes all cells that weren't needed.<p>
 *
 * @param <C> the cell type
