  description: >
               Films in which the protagonist or protagonists are thrust into a series of events that 
               typically include violence, extended fighting, physical feats, and frantic chases.

adult:
  description: >
               Category of films or videos centered around sexual activity. At the milder end of the 
               adult spectrum the sex is portrayed with full nudity but without any type of graphic 
               detail, while hardcore adult films can be extremely graphic and even violent.

adventure:
  description: >
               Exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales.
               
animation:
  description: >
               Films in which each frame is produced individually, whether generated as a computer 
               graphic, or by photographing a series of drawn images (an animated cartoon), or by 
               repeatedly making small changes to a model (see claymation and stop motion), and 
               then photographing the result.

comedy:
  description: >
               Light-hearted plots consistently and deliberately designed to amuse and provoke laughter
               by exaggerating the situation, the language, action, relationships and characters.

crime:
  description: >
               A crime film is a type of film focusing on the lives of criminals. The stylistic 
               approach ranges from grittily realistic portrayals of real-life criminal figures (crime 
               drama) to the far-fetched evil doings of imaginary arch-villains (master criminal 
               films.) Criminal acts are almost always glorified in these movies.

drama:
  description: >
               Serious, plot-driven presentations, portraying realistic characters, settings, life 
               situations, and stories involving intense character development and interaction.

documentary:
  description: >
               Depicts reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction, education, or maintaining a
               historical record.

family:
  description: >
               A type of film aimed at the children's market and/or made for family viewing. Usually 
               consisting of comedies or adventures, these films are often based on children's 
               literature and can involve any number of helpful animals, friendly supernatural beings 
               and fantasy worlds, all geared to stimulate and appeal to the imagination. Whatever the 
               situation, there is little or no offensive material and generally a lesson is learned 
               on the way.              
               
fantasy:
  description: >
               A type of film commonly associated with the fanciful worlds of fairy tales or imaginary 
               lands, films dealing the wonders of magic and magicians, with the doings of gods, 
               angels, elves, fairies, gnomes and other supernatural beings. Anything drawn from a 
               completely invented world, with some element of sorcery or inventive zoology, can 
               qualify, though the most common forms are ones based in the era of princes and 
               princesses, swords and dragons.

history:

               Historical fiction and period films where the story takes place in the 19th century or 
               earlier. 

horror:
  description: >
               Films designed to frighten and to invoke our hidden worst fears, often in a terrifying, 
               shocking finale, while captivating and entertaining us at the same time in a cathartic 
               experience.

mystery:
  description: >
               A mystery is primarily concerned with solving a crime or a puzzle. The standard mystery 
               generally revolves around a murder which must then be solved by policemen, private 
               detectives, or amateur sleuths. Typically, the viewer is presented with a series of 
               likely suspects, some of who are "red herrings," -- persons with motive to commit the 
               crime who didn't actually do it -- and attempts to solve the puzzle along with the 
               investigator. 
  
music:
  description: >
               Films which emphasize full-scale scores or song and dance routines in a significant way 
               (usually with a musical or dance performance integrated as part of the film narrative), 
               or they are films that are centered on combinations of music, dance, song or choreography.
romance:
  description: >
               A film which deals with a sentimental relationship between two (or more) characters as 
               its basis. Possibly the biggest purveyor of escapism in film, the romance film plays on 
               the viewer's assumption of what romance is like: long stares into a significant other's 
               eyes accompanied by sunsets, birds singing, and the sounds of violins playing in the 
               background (the romance as transcendental bliss). The story inevitably revolves around 
               two lovers who meet, fall in love, and then must deal with the obstacles thrown in their
               way -- everything from social-class structures, to parental disapproval, to death -- 
               oftentimes with a great sacrifice made on the part of one individual.

"science fiction":
  description: >
               Quasi-scientific, visionary and imaginative - complete with heroes, aliens, distant
               planets, impossible quests, improbable settings, fantastic places, great dark and shadowy
               villains, futuristic technology, unknown and unknowable forces, and extraordinary 
               monsters, either created by mad scientists or by nuclear havoc.

  description: >
               Films that evoke excitement and suspense.
               
"tv movie":
  description: >
               Films made directly for TV.
               
war:
  description: >
               A movie genre where war is either the major action of the film or the essential background
               for the film's action. Though largely focused on combat or preparation for fighting, the 
               genre also embraces other war-related subjects: prisoners of war, resistance fighters in 
               occupied countries, spy activities during wartime. War can also serve as a context for 
               highly dramatic situations though the characters may not be directly involved in the 
               fighting. 
               
western:
  description: >
               A eulogy to the early days of the expansive American frontier.
